"""
This module defines data models used in the transcription-enabled core of the application.

Currently, it provides the ReelItem dataclass, which encapsulates all relevant information
about an Instagram reel download, including its URL, status, file paths, captions, transcripts,
and error details. This model is used to manage and track the state of reel downloads and
their associated metadata throughout the application's workflow.
